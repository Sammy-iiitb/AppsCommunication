# AppsCommunication
- This android application is linked to my another application which is Notification Sender.
- Basically what happens is this application sends an implicit broadcast with some data fetched from the database and the other application receives it and displays it on the activity.
- To use the notification functionality of the Notification Sender App change the manifest of the Application and make the main activity as the launcher activity.
